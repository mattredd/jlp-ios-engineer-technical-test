#  JLP Test

This repository is for my technical test with John Lewis Partnership.

The app is built using both UIKit and SwiftUI. I have used UIKit to build the product grid and SwiftUI to build the product detail page. I have used the coordinator pattern to move between the views and have used the mock data files provided as the source of data.

## Improvements

Better handling of images when there is an error downloading the image. Would like to try to download the images again instead of just showing an error image.
